          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex
          institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is
          also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system
          while informal education is unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels
          that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
          education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the
          teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education,
          and on the subject, like science education, language education, and
          physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental
          states and qualities of educated people and the academic field
          studying educational phenomena.

          The precise definition of education is disputed and there are
          disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent
          education is different from indoctrination by fostering critical
          thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and
          improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes
          children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips
          them with the skills needed to become productive members of society.
          This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local
          and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of
          education. For example, governments set education policies to
          determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or
          must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been
          influential in promoting primary education for all children.

          ypes of education are often divided into levels or stages. The most
          influential framework is the International Standard Classification of
          Education, maintained by the United Nations Educational, Scientific
          and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It covers both formal and
          non-formal education and distinguishes levels based on the student's
          age, the duration of learning, and the complexity of the discussed
          content. Further criteria include entry requirements, teacher
          qualifications, and the intended outcome of successful completion. The
          levels are grouped into early childhood education (level 0), primary
          education (level 1), secondary education (levels 2–3), post-secondary
          non-tertiary education (level 4), and tertiary education (levels
          5–8).[39] Early childhood education, also known as preschool education
          or nursery education, is the stage of education that begins with birth
          and lasts until the start of primary school.
